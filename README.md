# GoAnimate 2016
This LVM Project is simular to Vyond 2018 but i'm downgrading some old stuff to make it look like it's 2016 to make this lvm stable & work perfectly.
# How to Use
To access this service, install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) then clone/download this project.	Once done, unzip the folder, copy the path, and execute the following commands in your command prompt (where `{PATH}` is the folder path you copied):
```console
cd "{PATH}\GoAnimate-2016-master"
npm install
npm start
```
**When done, go to your web browser and navigate to `localhost`.**
# Alternate Startup Method
In GA 2016, there is a file called faststart.bat, and with this file, you can start GA 2016 faster, and easier, without opening up command prompt and typing all of this in command prompt.
